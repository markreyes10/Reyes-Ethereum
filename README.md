## REMIX ETHEREUM - CREATING TOKENS

# Description
This Solidity application shows the fundamental syntax and capabilities of the Solidity programming language by demonstrating how to create tokens, remove tokens to specific addresses, and restore balances. The goal of this program is to give individuals who are unfamiliar with Solidity a place to start learning about it.

# Getting Started
Written in Solidity, a programming language used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, this application is a straightforward contract that demonstrates the creation procedure for a token. The function of creating new tokens or coins, removing existing ones, and displaying addresses and balances are all contained in the contract.

# Executing the program
